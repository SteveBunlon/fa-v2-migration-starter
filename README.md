# Agent-nodejs microservice
This sample project allows you to quickly onboard on Forest Admin using agent-nodejs as a microservice, and to migrate step by step from forest-express-sequelize to agent-nodejs

# Methods
You can onboard to the new agent-nodejs by either testing it first in a separated project, or by creating/using an environment on your actual project
Be careful of the following:
- Using a side project will force you to re-configure your layout (it is not possible to take the layout from your actual project to your side project)
- It is also impossible to copy any layout you would configure in your side project, to your actual project 

In other word, working on a side project provides security: you will not impact in any ways your actual project, but might require some layout manipulations once migrating your actual project to agent-nodejs.

## Use a new project (preferred)
1. Follow the quick start in our [documentation](https://docs.forestadmin.com/developer-guide-agents-nodejs/getting-started/quick-start) and use this current repository at the step `Create a new JavaScript (Or TypeScript) project`.
2. Copy the environment variables from the project which has been generated by the command line into the `.env` file from this repository.
3. [Start your project](#run-your-project)

## Use an existing project
You can start migrating to agent-nodejs using either a dedicated remote environment, or your own development environment.
Be careful of the following: 
- Using your own development environment might cause layout loose. Make sure you are working on a fresh branch without any layout changes
- Working on a remote environment might be tedious. Anytime you do a change, you will need to deploy to your environment to observe the change. you might to give a shot to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) which allows you to work locally with a remote accessible url over https

In this guide, we will guide you to start migrating to agent-nodejs, using both ways.

### Using a development environment (preferred)
1. Copy the development environment variables from your initial project (usually in `.env` file)
2. Shutdown your initial project
3. [Start this project using](#run-your-project)
4. Reach your development environment on `https://app.forestadmin.com`

### Using a remote environment
<b>DISCLAIMER: DO NOT use the environment you are about to work on for anything related to other environments (layout, layout copies...). This environment should be used as a sandbox only, and should never be considered by anyone in your team besides you, unless you are done with the changes and deploy it to production</b>

From your project settings:

1. Create your environment
   ![Alt text](./screenshots/add-new-environment.png?raw=true "Create a new environment")
2. Give your environment a name
   ![Alt text](./screenshots/name-environment.png?raw=true "Name environment")
3. Provide the application URl on which the environment can be reached out
   ![Alt text](./screenshots/application-url.png?raw=true "Application url")
4. Provide the database url, skip this step if you already know it
   ![Alt text](./screenshots/database-url.png?raw=true "Database url")
5. Gather your environment variables, and paste them in the `.env` file
   ![Alt text](./screenshots/environment-variables.png?raw=true "Environment variables")
6. Deploy this sample project (using a remote instance or using ngrok)

You should then be redirected to your environment.

# Run your project
Run the following commands in two separated terminal: 
- `npm run build:watch` this will transpile your typescript files into interpretable javascript in the `dist` folder.
- `npm run start` this will start a nodemon process, to serve your application watching for any file changes from your dist folder.
